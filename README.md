Functional Perspectives:

Recap of functional programing before moving one with Design Patterns matter.

-Ops class: implements 'Add' function and also exemplify the literal 'deleate' show how a function does not always need to be inside a class, but also insied another function anonumously.
-Program 2: shows how it can be implemented right on the Main mehotd as a nested function, and, anonumously as well.
-Action Deletage: In most cases, defning delegates isn't necessary. Generic arguments relate to the types of arguments this function take.
-Function Delegate: This is always generic where TR has the type of return value.
